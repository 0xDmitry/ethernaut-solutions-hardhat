# Ethernaut CTF - Hardhat edition

## What is Ethernaut by OpenZeppelin

[Ethernaut](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut) is a Web3/Solidity based war game inspired in [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/), to be played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

The game acts both as a tool for those interested in learning Ethereum, and as a way to catalog historical hacks in levels. Levels can be infinite, and the game does not require to be played in any particular order.
